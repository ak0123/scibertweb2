# Project Objective:
# The goal of this project is to help people on the front-line fighting COVID-19 find the most relevant research papers to better understand key pain-points and apply these findings into their plans and operations in addressing the pandemic.

# The main issue is that more papers are published than there are qualified people to refind and leverage the knowledge.

# This project can help to simplify the search process and bring the most relevant search results to eye-level for doctors, virologists, and other contributors mitigating the pandemic.

# This project was forked from Issac MG's SciBERT Embeddings Analysis https://www.kaggle.com/isaacmg/scibert-embeddings
# important you follow setup instructions in link above before proceeding

# as of May 2020, this code yields slug size of 1.2 G when web deploying to heroku via 'git push heroku master'
# requires further research to get this to compliant slug size
